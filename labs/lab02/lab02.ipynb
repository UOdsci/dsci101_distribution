A piece of text is called a *string* in Python. Lastly, you'll see how to work with *arrays* of data, such as all the numbers between 0 and 100 or all the words in the chapter of a book. This will be essential learning for the next lab, where you'll tackle one of the most important concepts in Data Science: the Table and associated operations. \n"
