    "Ben and Frank are trying see what the best Thai restaurant in Eugene is. They survey 1500 UO students selected uniformly at random, and ask each student what Thai restaurant is the best (*Note: this data is fabricated for the purposes of this homework*). The choices of Thai restaurant are Sweet Basil Express, Drumrongthai, Manola's Thai Cuisine, and Tasty Thai. After compiling the results, Ben and Frank release the following percentages from their sample:\n",
    "\n",
    "|Thai Restaurant  | Percentage|\n",
    "|:------------:|:------------:|\n",
    "|Sweet Basil Express | 8% |\n",
    "|Drumrongthai | 52% |\n",
    "|Manola's Thai Cuisine | 25% |\n",
    "|Tasty Thai | 15% |\n",
    "\n",
    "These percentages represent a uniform random sample of the population of UO students. The sample suggests that UO students heavily prefer Drumrongthai to other Thai restaurants, but to what extent does this sample reflect the overall population's preference (the entire population of all UO students)? To answer this, \n",
    "\n",
    "1. We could take more random samples and compare them to our initial sample. However, this is time- and cost-intensive and if we could do this, we probably would have taken a larger initial sample anyway.\n",
    "2. We could take our estimate for UO's favorite Thai restaurant (Drumrongthai, 52%) at face value and decide that this is as good as it gets.\n",
    "3. We could bootstrap our sample by resampling it thousands of times to create a confidence interval for our estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "You've probably guessed that the third option is our best one. But why? In lieu of having the true population estimate at hand, our sample is what we have to work with. The estimate itself is ok, but its even better to know how much this estimate might have varied (as if we had taken multiple random samples and not just one). By bootstrapping our sample, we are tacitly acknowledging that our sample estimate is almost certainly wrong, but a confidence interval derived via resampling provides a range of values that could contain the true value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this sample, we will attempt to estimate the corresponding *parameters*, or the percentage of the votes that each restaurant will receive from the entire population.
